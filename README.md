# CROP PREDICTION MODEL

The agriculture which occupies about 60% of the land in India is the most widely practiced profession. The process starts with deciding which crop should be grown in the field. At this stage a wrong decision can lead to losses in terms of yield, manpower, money etc. 

Knowing which crop is best suited for the soil type and the general weather conditions in the targeted area can increase the reliability on the crop to be cultivated. 

We have built a Machine Learning based crop prediction model as a solution for the same. This is supervised learning model which implements classification algorithms to predict the crop that is best for the given conditions of soil and weather. 

We have deployed this ML model into a simple Web Application which asks for soil parameters and the location of agriculture, it uses weather API to collect weather parameters and as a result predicts the crop to be grown.
